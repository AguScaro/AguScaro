- **👋 Hi, I’m @AguScaro.**
- I am an Assistant Researcher in the Council of Scientific and Technological Research (CONICET) of Argentina.
- I am developing my archaeological research in the north-western region of Argentina (Central-South Andean area) within the Institute of Andean Ecorregions and the National University of Jujuy. My main interest is focused on landscape and materiality studies, with an interdisciplinary and multi-proxy approach centred in ceramic studies. In recent years, I have focused my studies on the manufacture and uses of ceramics, considering experimental and ethnographic/ethnoarchaeological approaches.

- **I'm currently working on:**
* Pottery manufacture and uses in the Andean region.
* Landscape studies and their relationship with materialities.
* Open science repositories for ceramic studies.

- 👀 I’m interested in using DB for research in archaeology, Open Science, and collaborative work in and out of the academic world.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, and SQL.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different research approaches for ceramic studies.
